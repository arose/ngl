NGL is an on-line viewer for proteins and other molecular structures. It includes a server that enables remote access and display of trajectories e.g. from molecular dynamics simulations. By requiring only a web browser (no plug-ins needed), collaborative visual analysis and sharing of data are facilitated. Trajectories are instantly processed (on demand) to allow display from raw data sources, i.e. while running a simulation on a supercomputer.

Features
========

* File types -  load .pdb, .gro, .obj, .ply or .xtc (server) files; save .pdb files
* Trajectory server - remotely access trajectories e.g. from molecular dynamics simulations
* Representations - spacefill, ball+stick, licorice, hyperball, line, backbone, tube, cartoon, ribbon, trace
* Attributes - use the element name, atomic b-factor, residue index and many more to adjust the color and size of representations
* Processing - trajectories are automatically centered and superposed (respecting periodic boundaries); secondary structure assignment and chain names are added when missing
* Selection language - choose atoms for display, processing, loading
* Picking - click on a representation to learn to which atom it belongs
* Speed - your graphics card is used through WebGL
* Screenshots - high resolution renderings in .png, .jpg or .webp (Chrome) format
* Scripting support - control every aspect through JavaScript
