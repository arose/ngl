		<h2>Selection inputs</h2>

		A selection input is a text field in which to enter [page:Selection-language selection strings]. It grows or shrinks to adjust to the selection length. Upon typing the background is colored blue to indicate changes that are not applied. Pressing the *Enter* key applies the selection and the background is colored red or white to report whether the selection is incorrect or correct, respectively.
